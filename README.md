# block-interleaved-sparse-matrix


Todo: 
- [x] setup dense matrices vector and standard ordered
- [x] setup sparse matrices vector and standard ordered
- [ ] solve each type of matrix for an LU decomposition
  - [ ] in place
  - [ ] out of place
- [ ] Time all of the operations and setup corresponding tests with micm
- [ ] show how data can be set directly on the underlying values of the eigen matrices
- [ ] Explore the GPU usage of eigen
- [ ] Explore doing the same operations using cusparse
